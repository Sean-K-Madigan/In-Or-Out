## Project Description

The goal of this prohject is to apply eveerything we have learned in the first two thirds of our Bootcamp. We are creating a full stack application called In-Or-Out. This appplication will fill what we feel is a lacking social media niche where users will be able to create activities their friends and connections will be able to see and join. Additonally, Users will be able to sign up to participate in the activities prganized by their friends and connections. This will solve the problem of having to reach out to multiple groups of people in order to get a group together to participate in an activity. We are leanring how to implement teamwork, shared repos, handlebars, render engines, and the MVC architecture.
